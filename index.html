                                        <p>Born to a musically gifted family, Susan Sukman grew up on the West Side of Los Angeles. As a singer, she was discovered and signed to a recording contract by Fred Foster, President of Monument Records. Foster nicknamed her "Susan Sands" and signed her to a contract to record four sides for the company. She toured with other Monument performers including Boots ( yakety sax) Randolph 
Roy Orbison and performed with them at the Playboy Club on Sunset in Hollywood. Her recording of Say A Prayer for Michael appeared on the charts nationwide and was on the Billboard chart in the Midwest. Susan's touring increased her popularity but because of the grueling schedule, she rejected the life "on the road" and returned to California. It was there she started her new career of Casting Director after getting a job working at Paramount as a secretary/receptionist. </p>

                                    <p> Susan McCray, celebrity casting director of Michael Landon and his many successful productions, introduced her perfume line, Nightfall by Susan McCray, in 2010. Susan has launched the careers of some of the most famous actors like Jason Bateman, Christina Applegate, Paul Walker and Melissa Gilbert. The line "Nightfall", named after a musical composition of her Oscar-winning father Harry Sukman, is melodious like the memories of his music. Her successful Hollywood career was always in the first place, but from the time when she was eight, she began to develop a passion for creating and experimenting with perfumes. The inspiration was her mother Francesca Paley, a musician, painter and fashion designer, from whom she inherited a keen sense of style. </p>
                                    
                                
                                    
                                        <p>Nightfall is 100% natural Eau De Parfum. Like the notes of a musical composition, Nightfall is a beautiful melody of white flowers, accompanied by citruses and fresh basil. Being gentle and alluring, this fragrance can be worn on any occasion, day or night, helping to highlight and draw a woman's inner beauty and confidence. The smell is like a breath of spring, refreshing and sophisticated, seductive and mysterious. Susan remembers her mother's advice never to reveal the name of the fragrance she wears and created her own perfume for people to wonder what it is.</p>

                                    <p>Susan authored her first children’s book , Harry’s Piano, based on the young life of her father, Harry Sukman, and his love for the piano. Harry's Piano is the charming tale of the young life of Academy Award-winning composer, Harry Sukman, written by his daughter, Susan Sukman McCray. The book tells the story of when he began playing piano at the age of five until his first performance as concert pianist at the famous Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood California.  The book contains a CD with two selections composed and performed by Harry Sukman. The book has received beautiful reviews and is enjoyed by children and their families. A timeless story of hard work and determination, Harry's Piano is a gift that will inspire young people to reach for their dreams.
</p>
                                    
                                    <p>From Harry's humble birth in Chicago to his moving to California and conducting his first concert, Harry's Piano will touch the hearts of children everywhere.
Told with the loving hand only a parent's child could provide, Susan McCray shares every milestone that led to Harry Sukman becoming a successful concert pianist, conductor, and composer. Children will follow Harry as his first piano is lifted through the window into his parents' third-story apartment in Chicago. They will read about the hours and hours of practice Harry committed himself to and the music professors who helped Harry hone his talents. And children will share in the excitement of Harry's decision to leave Chicago and move to California, where he meets Mr. Young, who foretells of the future Harry will live.</p>

<p>The illustrations--provided by Karen C. Rhine--are as moving as the story. </p>
